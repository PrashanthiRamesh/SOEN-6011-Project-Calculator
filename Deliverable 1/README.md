### Function- F9: x^y

## Definition

Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as x^y, involving two numbers, the base x and the exponent or power y. When y is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, x^y is the product of multiplying y bases:


```
f(x)= x^y
```

```
x^y= x*...*x (y times)
```

## Domain

All real numbers

```
{(x,y)∈R^2 : (x≥0 & y≠0) or x>0}
```

## Co-domain

All positive real numbers (never zero)

```
{(x,y)∈R:x>0}
```

## Characteristics

In an exponential graph, the "rate of change" increases (or decreases) across the graph.

The exponential graph crosses the y-axis at (0,1).

The exponential graph increases, when x>1.

The exponential graph decreases, when 0 < x < 1

The exponential graph is asymptotic to the x-axis - gets very, very close to the x-axis but, in this case, does not touch it or cross it.
